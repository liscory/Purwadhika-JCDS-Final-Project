                    In this project, we position ourselves as a part of the Data Scientist Team 
                    in a Financial Institution, MPL Bank, in Washington DC, USA. 
                    We are assigned to work on a project to develop a Machine Learning (ML) solution. 
                    The project owner is the Underwriter Team of MPL Bank. 
                    We will help the Underwriter Team to make an improvement in their process of underwriting, 
                    specifically in the process of property appraisal and valuation.

                <p class="light-300">
                    MPL Bank orders the appraisal through a third party, an appraisal management company (AMC), 
                    in order to comply with the federal appraiser independence requirements. 
                    However, the appraisal process performed by an external party has a risk of fraud or 
                    producing erroneous results. Thus, the project owner wants to address these issues.

            <p class="text-muted light-300">
                Based on the elicitation process with the project owner, 
                we found that they want to improve the accuracy of their underwriting process, 
                specifically in the process of evaluating the appraisal. 
                In the process of evaluating appraisals, there are some risks that the project owner 
                wants to minimize, such as fraud and erroneous appraisal results given by the AMC. 
                In addition, there is also a problem that often happens regarding the difference between 
                the agreed offer made by a borrower and the property seller and the actual property valuation. 
                Since lenders can’t lend out money more than a property is worth, 
                all of these risks may cause the project owner to determine wrong appraisal value 
                and to make a wrong decision whether to give the loan to a borrower.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-muted light-300">
                To address these risks and improve their business process, 
                the project owner needs a reliable autonomous system that can provide 
                an estimation value that can be used to compare the value given by the AMC.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-muted light-300">
                The expected output of this project is a system that can make an estimation 
                of an accurate and reasonable value (price) for a property based on the aspects of 
                the property by using ML. However, due to the limitation of our 
                time budget, we limit the capability of our model in this project to predict an 
                output only for properties with grade lower than Exceptional, since Exceptional 
                properties have a price range that is very different than the rest of properties with other grades.

                    Since the value (price) that we want to predict is a continuous value, 
                    this problem can be addressed with Supervised Learning, more specifically with Regression.

                    The risk that may be caused by wrong prediction from the ML model is profit 
                    loss especially when the model gives under appraised value (price).
